# Android-SharedPreferenceHelper

**Simplifies usage of the default Android SharedPreferences Class.**

The developer can do in a few lines of code which otherwise would have required several. Simple to understand as compared to the default class and easy to use.

# Salient Features

- One line initialization and setup
- Easily selecting whether to use default preferences or a custom preference file
- Predefined (data type defaults) and customizable (what you may choose) default values for each datatype
- Ability to set different default value for single use with just an additional param
- You can register and unregister `OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener` as you do for default class
